# SpellChecker
This program searches the text file webster to check whether a word given by the user is in the dictionary or not.  The word to be searched should be provided in the second argument. Using binary search via lseek and read, if the program finds the word in the provided dictionary, it prints "Yes." If it doesn't, it prints "No."
